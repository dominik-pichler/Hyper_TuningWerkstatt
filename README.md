# My Project

This project demonstrates the use of Hydra for managing configurations in both classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) tasks. 
The project includes configurations for different models and training setups, making it easy to run and experiment with various settings.

Hence, it is aiming to be a successor of the previous [TuningWerkstatt](https://github.com/dominik-pichler/TuningWerkstatt)
